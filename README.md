# R-esources
A repository of resources for those who need it - Un repositorio de recursos para quienes lo necesitan

_Buenas noches - Soy yo tu amigo_.
This repository is a resource dump of websites I find useful for all things related to what I do - biological statistics and data wrestling. I believe in open-source coding, sharing knowledge and helping others as I have been helped. So share wide and far for anyone who needs it.
